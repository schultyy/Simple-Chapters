# Simple Chapters

This is my first real Cocoa project, I needed something useful, where I can start with, so I began writing
this tool. I also want to contribute to the Podlove project (http://podlove.org/). Other tools may follow.
At the moment it can create a xml file with basic informations about the podast.

It uses a document based UI with basic auto saving capabilities.

More features comming soon!
